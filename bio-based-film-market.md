<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-based Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compostable Films</li><li>Non-compostable Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-based film market is divided into two main types: compostable films and non-compostable films. Compostable films are designed to break down naturally in industrial composting facilities, enhancing sustainability by reducing landfill waste. These films often derive from renewable resources like cornstarch or other plant materials. Non-compostable films, while also made from bio-based materials, do not decompose under composting conditions and may still contribute to environmental concerns if not disposed of properly. Both types serve distinct applications in packaging and other industries.</p></p>

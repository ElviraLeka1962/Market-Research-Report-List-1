<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drum Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Leading Trailing Shoe Brake</li><li>Two Leading Shoe Brake</li><li>Servo Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drum brakes are a type of braking system where friction is generated by brake shoes pressing against the inner surface of a rotating drum. The **Leading-Trailing Shoe Brake** uses one shoe that moves with the drum's rotation (leading) and another that moves against it (trailing), offering balanced performance. The **Two Leading Shoe Brake** has both shoes moving with the drum, providing higher braking force. The **Servo Brake** uses a self-energizing mechanism to amplify braking force, enhancing efficiency and control. Each type caters to specific vehicle and performance needs.</p></p>

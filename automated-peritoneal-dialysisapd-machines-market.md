<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Peritoneal Dialysis(APD) Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Type</li><li>Gravity Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) machines are categorized into two main types based on their operation: power type and gravity type. Power-type machines utilize motorized pumps to facilitate fluid movement during dialysis, allowing for precise control and automation of the dialysis process. In contrast, gravity-type machines rely on gravitational force to flow the dialysis solution, making them simpler and often less expensive but potentially less efficient. Both types aim to provide effective renal therapy while enhancing patient convenience and autonomy.</p></p>

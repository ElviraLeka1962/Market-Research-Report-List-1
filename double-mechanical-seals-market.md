<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double mechanical seals are crucial for preventing fluid leakage in various industrial applications. The pusher type seal utilizes a spring mechanism to maintain contact between the seal faces, adapting to wear over time, ensuring reliability. In contrast, the non-pusher seal relies on a stationary design that locks the seal faces in place, providing a more straightforward construction with less maintenance but potentially lower adaptability to wear. Both types serve specific applications, balancing factors like durability, maintenance, and operational efficiency.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3rd Generation EGFR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibody Class</li><li>Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The third-generation EGFR market consists of two main types: monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Monoclonal antibodies target specific EGFR mutations, offering a more precise treatment option for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Small molecule TKIs, on the other hand, are designed to penetrate cell membranes and inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway, effectively blocking tumor growth. Both classes focus on overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with earlier EGFR inhibitors, improving patient outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Solder Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Non-Corrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wave solder flux market is categorized into two primary types: corrosive and non-corrosive. Corrosive fluxes contain halides, which facilitate soldering but can lead to post-solder residue corrosion if not cleaned properly. They are often used for standard soldering applications where thorough cleaning is ensured. Non-corrosive fluxes, on the other hand, contain minimal or no halides, making them safer for sensitive electronics where residue can affect performance. They are preferred for high-reliability applications requiring minimal cleaning.</p></p>

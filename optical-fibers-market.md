<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Mode Fiber Optics</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber Optics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical fibers market consists mainly of two types: multi-mode fiber optics and single-mode fiber optics. Multi-mode fiber optics are designed for short-distance communication, allowing multiple light paths within a core, which leads to greater signal dispersion but simplified installation. In contrast, single-mode fiber optics have a smaller core and allow only one light path, making them ideal for long-distance transmission with minimal signal loss. Both types cater to different telecommunications, data centers, and networking applications.</p></p>

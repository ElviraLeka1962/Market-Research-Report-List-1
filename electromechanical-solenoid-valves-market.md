<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromechanical Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves</li><li>Sub-Step Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves</li><li>Pilot Solenoid Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromechanical solenoid valves are crucial components in fluid control systems, available in three main types. Direct-acting solenoid valves operate directly with the solenoid mechanism, controlling flow with minimal pressure. Sub-step direct-acting solenoid valves offer increased precision by regulating flow in smaller increments, ideal for applications requiring fine control. Pilot solenoid valves use a smaller solenoid to control a larger main valve, allowing for efficient management of high-pressure systems while reducing energy consumption and enabling remote operation.</p></p>

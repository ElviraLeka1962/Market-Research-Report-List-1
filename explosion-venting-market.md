<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Venting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flameless Explosion Vents</li><li>Explosion Vents/Panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion venting market comprises two main types: flameless explosion vents and traditional explosion vents/panels. Flameless explosion vents are designed to contain and redirect the force of an explosion without releasing flames, reducing fire hazards in enclosed spaces. Traditional explosion vents/panels, on the other hand, are engineered to break open during an explosion, allowing pressure to safely escape. Both types are essential for industries handling combustible materials, ensuring safety and compliance with regulatory standards.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Bias</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tires market comprises two main types: radial and bias. Radial tires feature layers of cords running perpendicular to the direction of travel, offering better flexibility, heat dissipation, and longer lifespan, making them ideal for modern, high-performance aircraft. Bias tires have crisscrossed cord layers, providing robust durability and higher load capacity, often used in smaller or older aircraft. Both types are designed to withstand extreme conditions, but radial tires are increasingly preferred for their efficiency and performance advantages.</p></p>
